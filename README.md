Add [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) dependencies to your Julia project.

## Overview

This package is a lot like Pkg from the Julia standard library, except that it is for
managing Conda packages.
- Conda dependencies are defined in `CondaPkg.toml`, which is analogous to `Project.toml`.
- CondaPkg will install these dependencies into a Conda environment specific to the current
  Julia project. Hence dependencies are isolated from other projects or environments.
- Functions like `add`, `rm`, `status` exist to edit the dependencies programmatically.
- Or you can do `pkg> conda add some_package` to edit the dependencies from the Pkg REPL.

## Install

```
pkg> add CondaPkg
```

## Specifying dependencies

### Pkg REPL

The simplest way to specify Conda dependencies is through the Pkg REPL, just like for Julia
dependencies. For example:
```
julia> using CondaPkg
julia> # now press ] to enter the Pkg REPL
pkg> conda status                # see what we have installed
pkg> conda add python perl       # adds conda packages
pkg> conda pip_add build         # adds pip packages
pkg> conda rm perl               # removes conda packages
pkg> conda run python --version  # runs the given command in the conda environment
pkg> conda update                # update conda and pip installed packages
```

For more information do `?` or `?conda` from the Pkg REPL.

**Note:** We recommend against adding Pip packages unless necessary - if there is a
corresponding Conda package then use that. Pip does not handle version conflicts
gracefully, so it is possible to get incompatible versions.

### Functions

These functions are intended to be used interactively when the Pkg REPL is not available
(e.g. if you are in a notebook):

- `status()` shows the Conda dependencies of the current project.
- `add(pkg; version="", channel="")` adds/replaces a dependency.
- `rm(pkg)` removes a dependency.
- `add_channel(channel)` adds a channel.
- `rm_channel(channel)` removes a channel.
- `add_pip(pkg; version="")` adds/replaces a pip dependency.
- `rm_pip(pkg)` removes a pip dependency.

### CondaPkg.toml

Finally, you may edit the `CondaPkg.toml` file directly. Here is a complete example:
```toml
channels = ["anaconda", "conda-forge"]

[deps]
# Conda package names and versions
python = ">=3.5,<4"
pyarrow = "==6.0.0"
perl = ""

[deps.llvmlite]
# Long syntax to specify other fields, such as the channel and build
version = ">=0.38,<0.39"
channel = "numba"
build = "*"

[pip.deps]
# Pip package names and versions
build = "~=0.7.0"
six = ""
some-remote-package = "@ https://example.com/foo.zip"
some-local-package = "@ ./foo.zip"

[pip.deps.nmslib]
# Long syntax to specify other fields
version = "~=2.1"
binary = "no"  # or "only"
```

## Access the Conda environment

- `envdir()` returns the root directory of the Conda environment.
- `withenv(f)` returns `f()` evaluated in the Conda environment.
- `which(progname)` find the program in the Conda environment.
- `resolve(; force=false)` resolves dependencies. You don't normally need to call this
  because the other API functions will automatically resolve first. Pass `force=true` if
  you change a `CondaPkg.toml` file mid-session.
- `update()` update the conda and pip installed packages.
- `gc()` removes unused caches to save disk space.

### Examples

Assuming one of the dependencies in `CondaPkg.toml` is `python` then the following runs
Python to print its version.
```julia
# Simplest version.
CondaPkg.withenv() do
  run(`python --version`)
end
# Guaranteed not to use Python from outside the Conda environment.
CondaPkg.withenv() do
  python = CondaPkg.which("python")
  run(`$python --version`)
end
# Explicitly specifies the path to the executable (this is package-dependent).
CondaPkg.withenv() do
  python = joinpath(CondaPkg.envdir(), Sys.iswindows() ? "python.exe" : "bin/python")
  run(`$python --version`)
end
```

## Details

### Conda packages

These are identified by a name, version and build.

The version must be a Conda version specifier, or be blank.

### Conda channels

If not specified in `CondaPkg.toml`, packages are installed from the `conda-forge` channel.

### Pip packages

These are identified by a name and version.

The version must be a Pip version specifier, or be blank.

Direct references such as `foo @ http://example.com/foo.zip` are allowed. As a special case
if the URL starts with `.` then it is interpreted as a path relative to the directory
containing the `CondaPkg.toml` file.

Additionally the binary mode specifies whether to only use binary distributions ("only") or
to never use them ("no").

### Backends

This package has a number of different "backends" which control exactly which implementation
of Conda is used to manage the Conda environments. You can explicitly select a backend
by setting the environment variable `JULIA_CONDAPKG_BACKEND` to one of the following values:
- `MicroMamba`: Uses MicroMamba from the package
  [MicroMamba.jl](https://github.com/cjdoris/MicroMamba.jl).
- `System`: Use a pre-installed Conda. If `JULIA_CONDAPKG_EXE` is set, that is used.
  Otherwise we look for `conda`, `mamba` or `micromamba` in your `PATH`.
- `Current`: Use the currently activated Conda environment instead of creating a new one.
  This backend will only ever install packages, never uninstall. The Conda executable used
  is the same as for the System backend. Similar to the default behaviour of
  [Conda.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPy/Conda.jl).
- `Null`: Don't use CondaPkg to manage dependencies. Use this if you are in a pre-existing
  Conda environment that already satisfies the dependencies of your project. It is up to you
  to ensure any required packages are installed.

The default backend is an implementation detail, but is currently `MicroMamba`.

If you set `JULIA_CONDAPKG_EXE` but not `JULIA_CONDAPKG_BACKEND` then the `System` backend
is used.

### Offline mode

You may activate "offline mode" by setting the environment variable
`JULIA_CONDAPKG_OFFLINE=yes`. This will prevent CondaPkg from attempting to download or
install new packages. In this case, it is up to you to ensure that any required packages are
already available (such as by having previously called `CondaPkg.resolve()`).

### Conda environment path

By default, CondaPkg installs conda packages into the current project. If you wish to
centralize the conda environment, you can set `JULIA_CONDAPKG_ENV=<arbitrary path>`.

**Warning:** If you do this, the versions specified in a per-julia-version `CondaPkg.toml`
can become un-synchronized with the packages installed in the shared conda environment.
In this case, you will have to re-resolve the dependencies using `resolve(; force = true)`.
This restriction might be alleviated in future `CondaPkg` versions.

### Verbosity

You can control the verbosity of any `conda` or `pip` commands executed by setting the
environment variable `JULIA_CONDAPKG_VERBOSITY` to a number:
- `-1` is quiet mode.
- `0` is normal mode (the default).
- `1`, `2`, etc. are verbose modes, useful for debugging.
